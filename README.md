# DESKPET - AI Project
Desk Pet is an AI-assisted robotic companion that autonomously navigates a desk, detects obstacles, and interacts with users through Wi-Fi control, a touch sensor, and expressive animations on an OLED display. The project combines mobility, AI-based object detection, and engaging user interaction, with object pickup as a future scope.
